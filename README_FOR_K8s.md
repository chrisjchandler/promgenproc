Generate Prometheus Listener Code:

Use the generator to create Prometheus listener code for monitoring the desired process within the container. For example, if you want to monitor a process named myapp within a container, you can use the following command:

./promgenproc -process-name myapp -interval 30 -port 9090 myapp_monitor.go

This command generates the myapp_monitor.go file, which contains the Prometheus listener code.

Build the Docker Image:

Next, you need to create a Docker image that includes the generated Prometheus listener code. Create a Dockerfile that copies the myapp_monitor.go file into the image and builds it. Here's a sample Dockerfile:


FROM golang:1.17

WORKDIR /app

# Copy the generated Prometheus listener code
COPY myapp_monitor.go .

# Build the Prometheus listener
RUN go build myapp_monitor.go

CMD ["./myapp_monitor"]

Build the Docker image using the following command:

docker build -t myapp-monitor:latest .

Replace myapp-monitor with an appropriate image name.

Push the Docker Image to a Registry:

Push the Docker image to a container registry accessible by your Kubernetes cluster. For example, if you're using Docker Hub:

docker push your-docker-username/myapp-monitor:latest

Kubernetes Deployment:

Create a Kubernetes Deployment manifest (e.g., myapp-monitor-deployment.yaml) that deploys the Docker image as a container within a Pod. Here's a sample manifest:

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp-monitor-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp-monitor
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp-monitor
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: myapp-monitor
        image: your-docker-username/myapp-monitor:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 9090

Apply the deployment to your Kubernetes cluster:
kubectl apply -f myapp-monitor-deployment.yaml

Expose Prometheus Metrics:

Expose the Prometheus metrics endpoint of the deployed container to allow Prometheus to scrape the metrics. You can use a Kubernetes Service and configure it to target the container's port. Create a Service manifest (e.g., myapp-monitor-service.yaml) and apply it:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myapp-monitor-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: myapp-monitor
  ports:
  - name: prometheus
    protocol: TCP
    port: 9090
    targetPort: 9090

kubectl apply -f myapp-monitor-service.yaml

Prometheus Configuration:

Update your Prometheus configuration to scrape metrics from the newly exposed service. Add a new job configuration to the Prometheus configuration file (prometheus.yml):

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'myapp-monitor'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['myapp-monitor-service-name:9090']


Replace myapp-monitor-service-name with the actual service name.

Restart Prometheus:

Reload or restart Prometheus to apply the new configuration.

Now, Prometheus should be able to scrape metrics from the container running your monitoring code. Make sure to adapt the steps and configurations to your specific Kubernetes environment and use case.
